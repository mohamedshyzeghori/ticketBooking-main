# "🎟️ Ticket Booking System (CLI-Based)

This project is my first Java-based Ticket Booking System, designed to strengthen my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) skills while implementing practical functionalities like user authentication, train search, ticket booking, and cancellation. Special thanks to Lovepreet Singh for his amazing tutorials and projects. His teaching helped me a lot!

🚀 Features
✔️ User Authentication – Secure sign-up and login system
✔️ Train Search – Find trains between selected stations
✔️ Seat Availability – View available seats before booking
✔️ Booking Management – Reserve and cancel train seats
✔️ Data Persistence – Store user and booking information

🛠️ Technologies Used
🔹 Java – Core logic and implementation
🔹 Gradle – Build automation and dependency management
🔹 Collections \& Streams API – Efficient data handling
🔹 OOP Principles – Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Polymorphism

📦 Setup \& Run
Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Sameer07x19/TicketBookingSystem.git
cd TicketBookingSystem
Step 2: Build the Project
./gradlew build
Step 3: Run the Application
./gradlew run
📌 How to Use
1️⃣ Sign Up – Register a new account
2️⃣ Login – Access your account securely
3️⃣ Search Trains – Enter source and destination
4️⃣ View Seats – Check seat availability before booking
5️⃣ Book a Seat – Select and confirm your seat
 6 Exit – Close the application

🏗️ Future Enhancements
🚀 Graphical User Interface (GUI) – Improve user experience
💾 Database Integration – Store user and train data persistently
🔧 Admin Panel – Manage train schedules and user bookings" and give markdown file generate
